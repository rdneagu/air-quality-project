    <span>Sulphur dioxide is a pollutant emitted into the atmosphere by human activity.</span>
    <span>SO2 is produced by volcanoes and in various industrial processes.
    Coal and petroleum often contain sulphur compounds, and their combustion generates sulphur dioxide.</span>
    <span>Further oxidation of SO2, usually in the presence of a catalyst such as NO2, forms H2SO4, and thus acid rain is formed.</span>
    <span>This is one of the causes for concern over the environmental impact of the use of these fuels as power sources.</span>
