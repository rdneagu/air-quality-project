    <span>Rather than being a pollutant, dew reduces pollution by cleaning up the air.</span>
    <span>Dew condensation is a common meteorological phenomenon.
    The condensation processes reduce pollutant concentrations of gases and particulates in the near-surface atmosphere.</span>
    <span>Dew is helpful for the settlement of atmospheric particulates,
    and its rate of removal of coarse particulates is better than for fine material.</span>
