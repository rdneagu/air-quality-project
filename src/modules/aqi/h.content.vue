    <span>Hydrogen is used to generate environmental-friendly energy.</span>
    <span>When hydrogen cycles through a fuel cell to create electricity that will power a car, its only by-products are heat and water. Therefore, hydrogen-fuelled vehicles emit no greenhouse gases or other pollutants.</span>
    <span>During combustion, hydrogen produces only water vapor, making it environmentally-friendly.</span>
