    <span>Particulates, also known as atmospheric aerosol particles, atmospheric particulate matter, particulate matter (PM), or suspended particulate matter (SPM)
    are microscopic particles of solid or liquid matter suspended in the air.</span>
    <span>Types of atmospheric particles include suspended particulate matter, thoracic and respirable particles, inhalable coarse particles,
    which are coarse particles with a diameter between 2.5 and 10 micrometers (μm) (PM10), fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) ultrafine particles, and soot.</span>
    <span>Particulates are the most harmful form of air pollution due to their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and blood streams unfiltered, causing heart attacks, respiratory disease, and premature death.</span>
