    <span>Wolfram (or Tungsten) is a metal with many industrial and military applications, including manufacturing of commercial and military ammunition.
    Despite its widespread use, the potential environmental effects of tungsten are essentially unknown.</span>
    <span>This study addresses environmental effects of particulate and soluble forms of tungsten, and to a minor extent certain tungsten alloy components,
    present in some munitions formulations.</span>
    <span>Dissolution of tungsten powder significantly acidifies soils.
    Tungsten powder mixed with soils at rates higher than 1% on a mass basis,
    trigger changes in soil microbial communities resulting in the death of a substantial portion of the bacterial component and an increase of the fungal biomass.</span>
    <span>It also induces the death of red worms and plants.</span>
