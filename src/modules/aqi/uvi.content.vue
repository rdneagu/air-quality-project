    <span>The link between air pollution, UV irradiation and skin carcinogenesis has been demonstrated within a large number of epidemiological studies.
    Many have shown the detrimental effect that UV irradiation can have on human health as well as the long-term damage which can result from air pollution.</span>
    <span>Additionally, while there are around 2800 different chemical substances emitted systematically into the air, our focus can be narrowed down to two chemical groups.
    These are namely particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, both of which should be assessed together with physical factors such as UV irradiation whereby they play a seemingly synergistic role in carcinogenesis</span>
