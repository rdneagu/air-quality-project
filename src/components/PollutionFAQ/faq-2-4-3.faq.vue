      Air pollution is a health and environmental issue across all
      countries of the world, but with large differences in severity.
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
      The burden of air pollution tends to be greater across both low and middle income countries for two reasons:
      indoor pollution rates tend to be high in low-income countries due to a reliance on solid fuels for cooking;
      and outdoor air pollution tends to increase as countries industrialize and shift from low-to-middle incomes.
