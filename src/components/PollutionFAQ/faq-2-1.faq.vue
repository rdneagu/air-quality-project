      Air, soil and water pollution cause roughly 40 percent of global deaths pollution. Air pollution
      contributes to respiratory diseases such as lung cancer, even in people who have never smoked a
      day in their life. Polluted water can carry diseases — and more than 1.2 billion people don’t even
      have clean water to drink or use to wash. Contaminated soil can transmit toxins and chemicals
      directly into our food.
