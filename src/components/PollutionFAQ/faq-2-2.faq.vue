      Humans aren’t the only creatures on this planet that are negatively affected by pollution. Water
      pollution upsets ecosystems on both land and sea, either by directly killing plants and animals or
      encouraging the growth of toxic algae — such as the Red Tide outbreak that is currently ravaging
      Florida’s coastline.

      Bees keep most of the fruits and vegetables that we eat alive — thanks to pollination — but they’re
      dying out because of the harsh chemicals we use on our crops. Without them, the primary
      pollinators, these plants are unable to produce the tasty fruits and vegetables that we love to eat.

      Even light and noise pollution are dangerous to animals. Turtle hatchlings rely on the light of the
      moon on the water to direct them to the ocean after they emerge from their eggs — beachfront
      properties with electric lights often lead to them moving in the wrong direction, and getting eaten
      by predators. Noise pollution interferes with animals such as whales that use sound to
      communicate.
