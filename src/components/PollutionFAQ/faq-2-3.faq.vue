      Many of the resources that we take for granted, such as water, aren’t infinite. As mentioned, even
      though our planet is 71 percent water, only three percent of it is drinkable. The other 97 percent of
      the water on our planet is salt water, which is undrinkable without being treated.

      We need to stop treating our planet’s resources as though they are infinite. They will run out if we
      continue to use them the way that we are. Without food that is safe to eat, water that is safe to
      drink and air that is safe to breathe, continuing to pollute the planet could lead to the end of the
      human race
